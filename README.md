# Salvage Parts System

A web based interface for managing salvage parts and exploring them in a 3D scene. The project uses React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS bundled with Vite.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher recommended)
- **npm**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your Supabase credentials if you want to connect to a database.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the development server

```bash

```

Vite will start a dev server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Features
